# status api

Serverless framework version of a simple status api written using golang.

This template is useful for bootstrapping a new project:

```
serverless create -u https://github.com/serverless/serverless-golang/ -p myservice
```

Use the make file to build the binaries needed to deploy. To deploy:

```
serverless deploy --aws-profile <profile>
```
